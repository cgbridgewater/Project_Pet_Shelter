                        Butterball was found as a stray in San Jose, severely emaciated, with every inch of her tiny body covered in thick clumps of fleas. At 4 months old, she was just skin and bones, weighing a measly 5lbs.

                        Thankfully, she was a resilient little girl who took to treatment quickly and was making incredible progress in just a few weeks time. She put on some weight and it wasn’t long before she was acting like a puppy again! It wasn’t long before this sweet girl charmed her way into the heart of one of The Dojo volunteers and the rest was history!

                        When a good Samaritan found Bay outside her garage, he was unable to stand on his own. She brought him to Animal Haven and we rushed him to our emergency vet. Bay seemed a bit of a medical mystery at first, and doctors were unclear if he was suffering from trauma or a neurological issue.

                        Finally, the vet diagnosed a painful abscess and bacterial infection, which luckily cleared up with antibiotics and anti-inflammatory medication! Soon, Bay because the happy, comfortable, fun-loving young cat we could see hints of through his pain. Bay is now thriving in his new home and living life as a beloved member of his family!

                        When Hurricane Ian hit Florida, Animal Haven took in animals from the hard-hit area of Manatee County. We welcomed Narwhal and her six nursing pups to The Dojo in October. Not long after her puppies were weaned, Mama Narwhal found her wonderful family!

                        Sal, a 17-year-old pitbull terrier mix, ended up at The Dojo Pet Shelter after his person was evicted. Arthritic and depressed, we knew the shelter was no place for a senior dog like this.
