                        Thankfully, she was a resilient little girl who took to treatment quickly and was making incredible progress in just a few weeks time. She put on some weight and it wasn’t long before she was acting like a puppy again! It wasn’t long before this sweet girl charmed her way into the heart of one of The Dojo volunteers and the rest was history!

                        Bobby came to us all the way from Cambodia and was discovered by a concerned citizen, who overheard a woman that was fed up with her pet dog. According to owner, Bobby was misbehaving and being destructive at home, causing her a lot of frustration, time and money. The owner was overheard claiming she had given up on her and claimed she was going to sell Bobby to a dog meat restaurant for misbehaving. <br /><br />But thankfully, Bobby's luck was going to change.

                        The concerned citizen, an animal lover herself, was so shocked and upset by what she heard, she immediately intervened. After several minutes of heated discussions, the citizen persuaded Bobby's owner to allow her to spare Bobby's life, offering to take the dog off her hands. The owner agreed. <br />
                        Once safely in the hands of our veterinary team, Bobby was immediately given love and veterinary treatment, including vaccinations and was dewormed.

                        3-months-old female kitten “Buttercup” was found on the side of a road. Our team found her lying paralysed, unable to move her back legs or even get up. She was extremely weak, dehydrated and generally in a terrible condition. We quickly learned that she had been hit by a motorbike and was left behind to die.

                        At the clinic, the veterinarians suspected that Buttercup sustained damage to her spinal cord, causing her hind legs to be paralysed. She was put on strict cage rest and antibiotics.For over two months, we have been working to help rehabilitate Buttercup. She has gained more and more motor control in her hind legs. We have equipped her with a special wheelchair, with which she cruises around at lightning speed.
